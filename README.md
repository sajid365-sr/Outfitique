## Usage

Users start by signing up and uploading images of their outfits through the Wardrobe page. The app processes these images by removing backgrounds and, optionally, generating AI-enhanced versions of the outfits before storing them in the database. When users navigate to the AI Suggestion page, all of their wardrobe images are fetched and sent to an AI model that analyzes them and generates matching outfit suggestions based on color, style, and occasion. Premium users can also access the Virtual Try-On feature, where their personalized AI avatar displays the suggested looks, allowing for a realistic preview of their style before making a decision.
